# Twitter-collection-embed-bug
<p>Bug with embedding videos from Twitter's "Publish" tools. http://publish.twitter.com</p>

<p>The idea is to be able to show a responsive, image + video area as pulled from a Twitter Collection.</p>
<p>This collection is curated via Tweetdeck, by simply adding URLs to a Twitter Collection.</p>

<p>See this codepen for a functional, bare bones example [https://codepen.io/anon/pen/pOOabm](Codepen)</p>

<p>Please submit a PR for comment or possible fixes, or for URLs to update the demo on Codepen to test.</p>
