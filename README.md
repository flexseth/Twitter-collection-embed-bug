# Twitter-collection-embed-bug
Bug with embedding videos from Twitter's "Publish" tools. http://publish.twitter.com

The idea is to be able to show a responsive, image + video area as pulled from a Twitter Collection. 
This collection is curated via Tweetdeck, by simply adding URLs to a Twitter Collection. 

See this codepen for a functional, bare bones example [https://codepen.io/anon/pen/pOOabm](Codepen)

Please submit a PR for comment or possible fixes, or for URLs to update the demo on Codepen to test.
